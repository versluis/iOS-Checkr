iOS-Checkr
==========

Checks your current iOS Version and lets your code react accordingly. This is useful if you need iOS 7 to do something that iOS 6 can't go.

This is a full project based on this code:

Note: 
Xcode 5 GM Seed does currently not allow to select a deployment target lower than iOS 6.0, hence I did not implement a check for iOS 5.
